## Who are you and what do you do?

Hi, I‚Äôm Rob, originally from Poland, moved to UK in 2015 - so it‚Äôs been 10 years now. Back then, THE grand plan was to enrol to BIMM music institute for a sound engineering degree and work my way up to becoming the next Hans Zimmer‚Ä¶ ambitious, I know üòÇ

I spent over 12 years producing electronic music, mostly drum and bass, and a couple of years DJ'ing - though only in my bedroom - and most recently, for about year and a half I‚Äôve been learning to play drums - a childhood dream of mine.

Outside of music and tech, I‚Äôm a big Lego fan (currently sitting at just over 20 sets) and a massive F1 enthusiast. Nothing beats a good race weekend!

## What first got you into tech?

I guess my dad. Ever since we had our first PC at home (Intel Celeron CPU clocking at a whopping 800 MHzüî•), he would show me how to open it up and maintain both the hardware and OS. I remember being fascinated by a printout of his mechanical engineering master's thesis written in Fortran back in the 80s. At some point, he brought me a CD with one of the early IDEs called "PajƒÖczek" (English: "Little Spider"), which became my first introduction to HTML and CSS.

During high school, I really got into Photoshop, creating graphics for friends and posters for local events. These skills later proved valuable during my apprenticeship at technical/vocational school, where I was offered a full-time job as a graphic designer. This was during an era when websites were designed entirely in Photoshop, "sliced," and passed to developers as raster graphics. I kind of miss those days - there was much more creativity involved, and websites tended to have that unique vibe.

## What does your typical working day look like?

After dropping my son off to school, I‚Äôd usually pop-in to a polish shop for a freshly baked bread rolls, get home, brew a cup off coffee and get ready for a morning stand-up which usually happens at 9:30. The first 15 minutes are reserved for quality banter - then we try to squeeze in 15 minutes of actual work updates.

Our team currently consists of just three developers (including myself), with a few colleagues from our Spanish branch helping out with AI-related features.

We solely work on a single project called NXS (Nexus) Data - an end-to-end solution for market data analysis and visualisation. For the most part I'm responsible for a front end side of the application, so typically I would be either implementing an entire new feature, refactoring legacy parts, or upgrading old packages driving modern use of modern solutions. Over the course of 5 years it evolved from being just a plugin to a full-fledged standalone application.

When I joined two years ago, I was tasked with building an admin panel for user and role management. Currently, I‚Äôm working on implementation of a secondary data ingestion system which will be used to feed data into AI driven anomaly detection model - exciting stuff!

## What‚Äôs your setup? Software and hardware. Pictures welcomed!

Hardware:

- Apple 14‚Äù M1 MacBook Pro - I was a Windows guy ever since my first PC, but once I tasted the world of MacOS a couple years back, I have never looked back.

- Secondary screen - Pixio Hayabusa 2, 24‚Äù full HD gaming IPS @240hz, brilliant panel, but a little small, mostly use it in portrait for the docs‚Ä¶
- MX Keys Mini + MX Master 3
- Ikea MITTZON 160x80 sit-stand desk
- Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro 80Ohm
- Yamaha HS8 + Focuswrite Scarlett Solo
- My pride and joy - Roland TD27 KV2 edrums

## What‚Äôs the last piece of work you feel proud of?

A few months ago, I had the pleasure of rebranding our entire app. Up until then, there hadn‚Äôt been a clear or consistent design direction, so it was a great opportunity to bring some cohesion and personality to the product.

It also gave me a chance to jump back into Figma and Illustrator - something I‚Äôve always enjoyed. I designed a new logo, created both light and dark themes, and implemented it. It was super refreshing task.

## What‚Äôs one thing about your profession you wish more people knew?

In recent years, coding has become incredibly accessible. You don‚Äôt need a fancy university degree to get into the field - just passion, patience, and a way to showcase your skills and problem-solving ability, whether through a portfolio or a hobby project.
