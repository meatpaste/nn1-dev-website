## Who are you and what do you do?

Hi I'm Roger, Senior Full Stack Engineer at Sign In App, I'm a full time geek, tech enthusiast, music lover and dad of one.

## What first got you into tech?

I've always been facscinated by how things work, my dad has told me that as a child I would take toys apart and put them back together instead of just playing with them. My first proper bit of tech was a ZX Spectrum, typing in code using the rubber keys and loading games of an external cassette player. The real catalyst to where I am today was when I first saw the web, I had the same itch to know how it worked and soon produced my first website using Notepad and hosting on GeoCities.

## What does your typical working day look like?

I normally get to the office early to beat the traffic, preferring to get up to date on emails/news over sitting in a queue of cars! After a coffee and stand-up meeting its time to work through the current task, usually either a ticket of my own or code review. There is plenty of time and encouragement to experiment with new ideas and to help others level up as we discover more efficient ways of working.

## What’s your setup? Software and hardware. Pictures welcomed!

My work PC is a 16" MBP, and I use a 13" MBA for personal projects. Usually tethered to a single 4k monitor (I used to run up to 3 screens but since 4k became prevalent and my eyes are still good, I prefer a single monitor). I also have a Ryzen tower PC although that doesn't get much use unless I need to burn some GPU time or (rarely) do some PC gaming. Somehow I find myself with 3 mechanical keyboards which has become a minor obsession, we type so much, why shouldn't it feel this good :D

## What’s the last piece of work you feel proud of?

Pretty much everything we put out at Sign In App feels significant, the software serves over 22k premises with over 1 million operations occuring per day, so you know that even a small change is having a wide impact.

## What’s one thing about your profession you wish more people knew?

Coders are very often un-sung heroes, because our output is often not very visual and we're seen to be always fixing 'problems'. Coders are basically learning at University pace for their entire career as the landscape changes around them and often much of this has to occur in personal time. It's a life long passion!

## Share with others something worth checking out. Not necessarily tech related. Shameless plugs welcomed.

Right now I'd encourage anyone to have at least an overview knowledge of AI, its not going away and the tools we have available today are likely the worst ones we'll ever have due to the rapid pace of development. Check out YouTubers such as [Matt Berman](https://www.youtube.com/@mattberman) for some great content. Finally don't be hesitant to try things out while there are so many free tier options available, it looks like this will eventually go away as companies seek a return on their investments!
